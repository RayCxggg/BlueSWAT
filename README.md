# BlueSWAT

This repository contains the artifact for BlueSWAT, a Bluetooth security framework for IoT devices based on eBPF. For details, please check out the paper _BlueSWAT: A Lightweight State-Aware Security Framework for Bluetooth Low Energy_ [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3658644.3670397) (ACM CCS 2024).

## Environment Setup

BlueSWAT is tested under Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL2. This artifact contains implementation on two embedded OS with open-source BLE stacks, i.e., [ZephyrOS](https://zephyrproject.org/) and [MynewtOS](https://mynewt.apache.org/). This artifact is tested on the Nordic 52840 Development Kit.

To flash USB device from WSL2, please install [usbipd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb). Besides, Install the [Segger JLINK Software and documentation pack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/). 

Download our code and required submodules of MynewtOS:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RayCxggg/BlueSWAT-Artifact.git
```

In a Windows shell, connect the board and attach it to WSL2:
```
usbipd list 
usbipd bind --busid <busid>
usbipd attach --wsl --busid <busid>
```

## Zephyr BLE stack

We are using ZephyrOS v2.2.0 for vulnerability reproduction.

### Setup

Please follow STEP ONE and TWO in the [doc](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.2.0/getting_started/index.html) to install dependencies.

Install needed Python packages:
```
pip3 install --user -r ~/BlueSWAT/ZephyrOS/zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
```

Install Zephyr Software Development Toolchain:
```
cd ~
wget https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/download/v0.11.2/zephyr-sdk-0.11.2-setup.run
chmod +x zephyr-sdk-0.11.2-setup.run
./zephyr-sdk-0.11.2-setup.run -- -d ~/SDK/zephyr-sdk-0.11.2
rm zephyr-sdk-0.11.2-setup.run
```

Set build environment variables:
```
cd BlueSWAT/ZephyrOS/zephyr
source zephyr-env.sh
```

### Build and Flash

Now, we build the BLE peripheral application for Nordic 52840 DK:
```
cd BlueSWAT/ZephyrOS
source scripts/config.sh
source scripts/build.sh
```

Everything is settled! Flash the board:
```
source scripts/flash.sh
```

### Monitor

You can use minicom to monitor the output:
```
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
```


## Mynewt NimBLE stack

### Setup

Follow the [doc](https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/get_started/index.html) native installation mode to install the dependencies.

### Build and Flash

Now, build the bootloader and BLE targets:

```
cd BlueSWAT/Mynewt
newt build nrf52_boot
newt build peripheral
```

Run the `newt create-image` command to create and sign the application image. You may assign an arbitrary version (e.g. 1.0.0) to the image:
```
newt create-image peripheral 1.0.0
```

Connect a micro-USB cable from your computer to the micro-USB port on the nRF52-DK board. 

Then, load the bootloader and the BLE application image onto the board:
```
newt load nrf52_boot
newt load peripheral
```

### Monitor

You can use minicom to monitor the output:
```
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
```

## A Testing Case

Here we use CVE-2020-10069 as a testing case. 

We use an nRF52840 dongle with Sweyntooth to reproduce the attack. Follow the [doc](https://github.com/Matheus-Garbelini/sweyntooth_bluetooth_low_energy_attacks) to build and flash sweyntooth firmware to the dongle, then launch the **Invalid Channel Map** attack to the victim (i.e. the nRF52840 DK). 

With the original vulnerable Zephyr v2.2.0 BLE stack, the stack will crash after we launch the attack. With BlueSWAT, the attacking packets will be detected and dropped.
